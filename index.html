I found it very satisfying when the client was happy and benefited by reaching the right market.

I spoke on the topic "Coding: The Modern Magic" where I covered what coding is, where it is being used, and the benefits of learning it, and taught a few basic coding concepts with Python to show how anyone could start learning. I also demonstrated coding live during the session. <br> This was my first experice teaching coding and hearing all the posive comments I recieved from the participants about how they now wanted to learn it inspired me to take it forward.</p>

            <br>
We worked in teams and collaborated to solve problems related to the auto and farm industries. We chose the problem of making shared mobility vehicles safe during the pandemic and explored innovative solutions. We proposed the idea of introducing safety features like smart barriers and hands-free (automatic) doors. We also made digital prototypes of our safe cars to demonstrate to stakeholders. Ultimately, we pitched our final solution to a panel of experts from industry and academia.
I learnt a lot in this programme including design thinking and innovative problem solving.

            <b>No Poverty</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            I worked with a team of 4 IB students from around the world over the span of a month. We started by researching the country we were assigned - Costa Rica and the social problems that it faced. We used SWOT analysis to come up with a business solution. The solution that we proposed was to start a business which employed handicapped people to make products for handicapped people. We had to create the entire business model - including the detailed costing.
            <br>
            As this was a fist time for me working with students from other countries and backgrounds- hearing their perspectives ad views on different topics was a truly eye-opening experience.

            <b>Access to Justice</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            In this month long programme, I worked with 3 other IB students from around the world to investigate into problems of injustice in Turkey. The solution that we proposed was to create a business plan which educates students in Turkey about the importance of freedom of speech and assembly.
            I met a lot of people from all around the world and heard their views on justice and liberty to truly understand and emphatise with the people of Turkey.
            <br>
            I was also selected as one of the top 5 participants to represent this forum.

        <p style="color: #F8E9D7; margin-left: 30px;">I participated in an innovation Shodhyatra(journey of exploration) along with 70+ volunteers from across India. We walked over 100 km through rural parts of Tamil Nadu over a week in search of traditional knowledge, unsolved problems and local innovations. I worked closely with grassroot level innovators and was mentored by Professor Anil Gupta(head of National Innovation Foundation, SRISTI and Honeybee Network).</p>

          <p style="color: #F8E9D7; margin-left: 30px;">I worked with a team of 4, representing our school at MOSAIC, to develop a prototype for their idea of a service that provided OTT subscriptions at subsidised rates. Our team was a last minute replacement for the previous team that dropped out, giving us less than a day to finalise an idea and develop a working app. Despite this, we managed to successfully finish both our pitch and prototype before time and placed 3rd in the competiton.</p>

            Global Research and Innovation Programme was a 6-month course conducted by Corporate Gurukul and NUS. We spent the first 5 months researching problems and coming up with our business plan and prototype. We covered everything from talking to government school students and understanding their situation to developing working prototypes to show them and receive feedback.
            <br>
            We spend the final week in NUS, finalising our ideas and pitching them to a jury of professors from the institution.
            <br>
            <br>
            We built an app and website for our idea- EduSphereX. It was an all-in-one platform for students of all backgrounds that covered their academic and social needs through its social media platform that better connected peers with both each other and the school and informed them about opportunities relating to their passions and interests. It provided notes and lectures on individual topics in subjects and even had VR experiences for certain concepts fully immerse the students in their learning. All the content was available in local languages to increase accessibility, especially among students from government schools. to  It also promoted holistic learning and community action by providing a list of community service opportunities for students to sign up for and directly connecting them with the people in charge.

          I love origami and have been doing it for as long as I can remember! Recently though I have also started teaching it to people around me. 
I have gone to government schools in my neighbourhood during weekends to teach them to make their own paper crafts like butterflies and peacocks. 
<br>
<br>
In the future, I also plan on using this to teach them math and physics concepts like fractions, geometry and aerodynamics.

          I have always been passionate about puzzles- especially jigsaw puzzles. I have solved more than 50 between 1000-1500 pieces. 
<br>
I also founded a puzzle club in my school with one other classmate where we would cover puzzles of all types- from rubies cubes and sudokus to jigsaws and brainteasers.
